# CameraView overlay demos
Some demos built around the overlay feature (preview + picture + video record) of @natario1's CameraView (https://github.com/natario1/CameraView) Android library.

### FreeDrawing ([link](https://github.com/RAN3000/CameraView-overlay-demos/tree/master/FreeDrawing))
You can paint on the camera with your fingers, you can record a video as you are drawing and snap a picture of the masterpiece!
Relies heavily on [Android Draw](https://github.com/divyanshub024/AndroidDraw?source=post_page).

I wrote a blog post explaining what's going on in more details, you can find the it [here](https://ran3000.github.io/2019/09/14/cameraview-interactivity.html).

### BasicWatermark ([link](https://github.com/RAN3000/CameraView-overlay-demos/tree/master/BasicWatermark))
Bare minimum camera overlay demo using CameraView:

- full screen camera preview
- little text as overlay that gets recorded
- video recording button + preview
- picture button + preview
- front/back camera button

Other demos will build upon it.

### Ideas for other demos

- something w/ Tensorflow
- something w/ OpenCV or dlib
