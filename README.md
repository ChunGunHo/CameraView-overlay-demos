# CameraView overlay demos
Some demos built around the overlay feature (preview + picture + video record) of @natario1's CameraView (https://github.com/natario1/CameraView) Android library.

### FreeDrawing ([link](https://github.com/RAN3000/CameraView-overlay-demos/tree/master/FreeDrawing))
You can paint on the camera with your fingers, you can record a video as you are drawing and snap a picture of the masterpiece!
Relies heavily on [Android Draw](https://github.com/divyanshub024/AndroidDraw?source=post_page).

// TODO add sample picture and video

### Ideas for other demos
 - something w/ Tensorflow
 - something w/ OpenCV or dlib
